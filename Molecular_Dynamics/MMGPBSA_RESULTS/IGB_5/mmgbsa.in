  ipb=2,
# Default. Dielectric model for all numerical PB procedures. Dielectric interface is implemented with level set function
# inp=1,
# Method to compute non-polar solvation DG. The total non-polar DG is modeled as a single term. Value of 2 for two terms
  indi=1,
# Default. Dielectric constant of the solute region.
  exdi=80,
# Default. Dielectric constant of the solvent region.
  emem=1,
# Default. Dielectric constant of the membrane.
  radiopt=0,
# Use radii from the prmtop file for both the PB calculation and for the NP calculation
  istrng=0.100,
# Ionic strength in Molarity (probably in M).
# pbtemp=310
# Temperature (in K) used for the PB equation, needed to compute the Boltzmann factor for salt effects.
